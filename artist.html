                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tracychahwan</a></i></p>
                <p><b>Bio:</b> Tracy Chahwan is a cartoonist and illustrator from Lebanon. She started her career in Beirut, 
                    producing street art and posters for local independent music venues like the Beirut Groove Collective, 
                    and working with the Samandal and zeez comics collective publishing experimental comics and anthologies. 
                    In 2018, she published her first graphic novel "Beirut Bloody Beirut", a story of two girls lost in the 
                    Beiruti night. After the Lebanese revolution in October 2019, she turned to journalistic comics, 
                    collaborating in books such as "Guantanamo Voices" and "Where to Marie? Stories of Feminisms in Lebanon". 
                    Tracy’s work is marked by the radical and collaborative energy of the artistic scene in Beirut, where she 
                    worked actively before moving to the U.S. in 2019.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> This drawing attempts to represent the fragmentation of living between two realities: 
                    one where life “goes on”, and one flooded with images of bombings, destruction, and death at a frequency 
                    that we cannot process normally. It is the artist’s response to what is happening in Gaza and Lebanon, 
                    but also a general feeling regarding the state of the world right now, where the comfort of some -  who 
                    get to continue living as if nothing is happening - comes at the expense of others, who are subjected to 
                    the most inhumane living conditions imaginable.

                <p><b>Bio:</b> Ali Asfour a Palestinian, Ramallah-based analog film photographer currently in Amman,
                    who skillfully balances exposing the Palestinian existence with preserving the beauty of its
                    roots, culture, and traditions. His work embodies the resilience of a people striving to thrive
                    despite adversity, inviting reflection and action toward justice.
                    Through his art, he revives the silent narratives of Palestinian life, weaving visual stories that
                    evoke both longing and nostalgia. His cinematic imagery and exploration of everyday
                    moments stand as powerful testimonies to the humanity of the Palestinian people, resisting
                    erasure and revealing the complex layers of their experience. Asfour’s photography was
                    recently showcased in a solo exhibition at New York’s Institute of Arab and Islamic Art and
                    has been featured in notable publications, including GQ Middle East, Atmos, and The New
                    Arab, as well as pages such as Waastaa and Nowness Asia. In addition to his work in
                    photography. He is a DJ and music selector with a deep passion for exploring diverse
                    musical landscapes. His sets are inspired by various sounds and scenes, embracing
                    rhythms and influences from different cultures and collectives worldwide. He also hosts a
                    monthly show on Mutant Radio, SADAA: Echoes of the MENA, where he delves into the
                    vibrant musical tapestry of the MENA region, connecting listeners to its rich, ever-evolving
                    sound.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> The image unfolds like a story layered with time. The old man, his
                    kuffiyeh draped with quiet pride. From his eye, the olive tree emerges — a symbol of rooted
                    defiance, its branches stretching toward futures yet untold. Behind him, a group of young
                    women sit, their presence tender yet powerful, like daughters woven into the fabric of the
                    land that he carries with him. This is not an isolated portrait; it is Palestine itself—a
                    convergence of memory and life, of generations bound by the soil, the struggle, and the
                    enduring love for what remains. The land is not just a backdrop but a living thread,
                    connecting the scars of the past to the quiet strength of those who will inherit its story.

                <p><b>Bio:</b> Lara Chahine lives and works in Lebanon. She is a self-taught freelance photographer and researcher. 
                    Her project “Bless Your Beauty,” created with the Arab Documentary Photography Program is her first long-term 
                    documentary project and the starting point of her career as an image-maker. Since then, she has been a 
                    photographer-in-residence in Switzerland, was  featured in numerous publications, and was considered 
                    one of the British Journal of Photography’s Ones To Watch in 2023. She has participated in solo and 
                    group exhibitions around the world, from Gulf Photo Plus Dubai to the Brussels Photo Festival. 
                    Her approach to photography is spontaneous, and her goal is to interpret the world around her, 
                    both contextually and visually. Chahine aims to match the appropriate medium of photography with the themes, 
                    messages or emotions she is trying to evoke.

                    they encouraged, challenged, and supported one another, bonded by a common spirit of playfulness.

                <p><b>Bio:</b> Born in 2001, Bayan Abu Nahla is a Palestinian visual artist from Gaza, where the realities of 
                    war and hardship were part of her daily life. During the war, she lost her home and everything she owned, 
                    including her art. Displaced from the very first day of the war on, she spent the initial months of the 
                    conflict in the Gaza Strip before eventually leaving. However, this was not the end of her artistic journey, 
                    but rather the beginning of a new chapter. Bayan’s artistic interests span various forms of visual art, 
                    with a particular focus on paper drawing, manual techniques, comics, and digital art. She has been practicing art 
                    since a young age, seeing it as a way to document her daily life and as a tool for understanding herself and 
                    exploring emotions linked to crises and hardships. Through her work, Bayan seeks to address profound humanitarian 
                    issues, focusing on how social and emotional environments affect individuals, especially in times of ongoing 
                    conflict. For her, art is not merely a form of expression, but a means to rebuild herself and her community 
                    in the face of adversity.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> This piece is an intense expression of deep emotions that emerge from the heart of the 
                    Palestinian experience. It depicts a pivotal moment in the life of a Palestinian, where the olive 
                    tree transcends its role as a mere plant. It becomes an integral part of the Palestinian’s identity, 
                    a symbol of resilience and roots, interconnected with everything around them, even within themselves. 
                    The artist was inspired to create this artwork during a moment of deep reflection, during her daily walks 
                    through a narrow street in the Palestinian countryside, specifically in Deir al-Balah. There, olive trees 
                    adorned the landscape, stretching as far as the eye could see. She would see the shiny olives, hanging in 
                    the air like small jewels, reflecting the sunlight that poured down from the sky onto the earth. 
                    These moments were filled with contemplation as if the olive tree itself carried a complete history within it, 
                    an ongoing narrative passed down through generations. The artwork depicts a fleeting glance into the future, 
                    one glance being enough to stir a heavy - deep feeling, as if that brief glimpse of what’s to come carried 
                    with it a shadow of despair. It felt as though the future itself was draped in darkness, looming just beyond 
                    the horizon, and all that remained was the agonizing wait for the inevitable destruction it promised. That 
                    glance left nothing behind but a profound sense of anxiety and foreboding, slowly seeping into my body like 
                    a slow-acting poison, draining hope from every corner. It was as if my very being was preparing to face an 
                    unavoidable fate, weighed down by the thought of a future that had already been written, leaving only the 
                    waiting to endure.

                    In these early stages of her artistic journey, she is still exploring different 
                    directions, discovering what art forms and techniques resonate with her. Over the past year, 
                    she has been finding inspiration in all the things that make her herself, in particular her 
                    Palestinian background. This interest and love for her heritage is reflected in her works, 
                    which focus on her Palestinian identity and the beauty of her home.
