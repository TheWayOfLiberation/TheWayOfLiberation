                <p><b>Bio:</b> Tracy Chahwan is a cartoonist and illustrator from Lebanon. She started her career in Beirut, 
                    producing street art and posters for local independent music venues like the Beirut Groove Collective, 
                    and working with the Samandal and zeez comics collective publishing experimental comics and anthologies. 
                    In 2018, she published her first graphic novel "Beirut Bloody Beirut", a story of two girls lost in the 
                    Beiruti night. After the Lebanese revolution in October 2019, she turned to journalistic comics, 
                    collaborating in books such as "Guantanamo Voices" and "Where to Marie? Stories of Feminisms in Lebanon". 
                    Tracy’s work is marked by the radical and collaborative energy of the artistic scene in Beirut, where she 
                    worked actively before moving to the U.S. in 2019.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> This drawing attempts to represent the fragmentation of living between two realities: 
                    one where life “goes on”, and one flooded with images of bombings, destruction, and death at a frequency 
                    that we cannot process normally. It is the artist’s response to what is happening in Gaza and Lebanon, 
                    but also a general feeling regarding the state of the world right now, where the comfort of some -  who 
                    get to continue living as if nothing is happening - comes at the expense of others, who are subjected to 
                    the most inhumane living conditions imaginable.

                <p><b>Bio:</b> Born in 2001, Bayan Abu Nahla is a Palestinian visual artist from Gaza, where the realities of 
                    war and hardship were part of her daily life. During the war, she lost her home and everything she owned, 
                    including her art. Displaced from the very first day of the war on, she spent the initial months of the 
                    conflict in the Gaza Strip before eventually leaving. However, this was not the end of her artistic journey, 
                    but rather the beginning of a new chapter. Bayan’s artistic interests span various forms of visual art, 
                    with a particular focus on paper drawing, manual techniques, comics, and digital art. She has been practicing art 
                    since a young age, seeing it as a way to document her daily life and as a tool for understanding herself and 
                    exploring emotions linked to crises and hardships. Through her work, Bayan seeks to address profound humanitarian 
                    issues, focusing on how social and emotional environments affect individuals, especially in times of ongoing 
                    conflict. For her, art is not merely a form of expression, but a means to rebuild herself and her community 
                    in the face of adversity.
                    </p>
                <p><b>Artwork:</b> This piece is an intense expression of deep emotions that emerge from the heart of the 
                    Palestinian experience. It depicts a pivotal moment in the life of a Palestinian, where the olive 
                    tree transcends its role as a mere plant. It becomes an integral part of the Palestinian’s identity, 
                    a symbol of resilience and roots, interconnected with everything around them, even within themselves. 
                    The artist was inspired to create this artwork during a moment of deep reflection, during her daily walks 
                    through a narrow street in the Palestinian countryside, specifically in Deir al-Balah. There, olive trees 
                    adorned the landscape, stretching as far as the eye could see. She would see the shiny olives, hanging in 
                    the air like small jewels, reflecting the sunlight that poured down from the sky onto the earth. 
                    These moments were filled with contemplation as if the olive tree itself carried a complete history within it, 
                    an ongoing narrative passed down through generations. The artwork depicts a fleeting glance into the future, 
                    one glance being enough to stir a heavy - deep feeling, as if that brief glimpse of what’s to come carried 
                    with it a shadow of despair. It felt as though the future itself was draped in darkness, looming just beyond 
                    the horizon, and all that remained was the agonizing wait for the inevitable destruction it promised. That 
                    glance left nothing behind but a profound sense of anxiety and foreboding, slowly seeping into my body like 
                    a slow-acting poison, draining hope from every corner. It was as if my very being was preparing to face an 
                    unavoidable fate, weighed down by the thought of a future that had already been written, leaving only the 
                    waiting to endure.

                    Palestinian background. This interest and love for her heritage is reflected in her works,

                <p><b>Bio:</b> Ali Asfour a Palestinian, Ramallah-based analog film photographer currently in Amman,
                    who skillfully balances exposing the Palestinian existence with preserving the beauty of its
                    roots, culture, and traditions. His work embodies the resilience of a people striving to thrive
                    despite adversity, inviting reflection and action toward justice.
                    Through his art, he revives the silent narratives of Palestinian life, weaving visual stories that
                    evoke both longing and nostalgia. His cinematic imagery and exploration of everyday
                    moments stand as powerful testimonies to the humanity of the Palestinian people, resisting
                    erasure and revealing the complex layers of their experience. Asfour’s photography was
                    recently showcased in a solo exhibition at New York’s Institute of Arab and Islamic Art and
                    has been featured in notable publications, including GQ Middle East, Atmos, and The New
                    Arab, as well as pages such as Waastaa and Nowness Asia. In addition to his work in
                    photography. He is a DJ and music selector with a deep passion for exploring diverse
                    musical landscapes. His sets are inspired by various sounds and scenes, embracing
                    rhythms and influences from different cultures and collectives worldwide. He also hosts a
                    monthly show on Mutant Radio, SADAA: Echoes of the MENA, where he delves into the
                    vibrant musical tapestry of the MENA region, connecting listeners to its rich, ever-evolving
                    sound.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> The image unfolds like a story layered with time. The old man, his
                    kuffiyeh draped with quiet pride. From his eye, the olive tree emerges — a symbol of rooted
                    defiance, its branches stretching toward futures yet untold. Behind him, a group of young
                    women sit, their presence tender yet powerful, like daughters woven into the fabric of the
                    land that he carries with him. This is not an isolated portrait; it is Palestine itself—a
                    convergence of memory and life, of generations bound by the soil, the struggle, and the
                    enduring love for what remains. The land is not just a backdrop but a living thread,
                    connecting the scars of the past to the quiet strength of those who will inherit its story.

                    Her project “Bless Your Beauty,” created with the Arab Documentary Photography Program is her first long-term 
                    documentary project and the starting point of her career as an image-maker. Since then, she has been a

                    one of the British Journal of Photography’s Ones To Watch in 2023. She has participated in solo and

                    Her approach to photography is spontaneous, and her goal is to interpret the world around her,

                <p> <b>Bio:</b> Muhammad Mustafa Abu Al-Hassan, a young Sudanese artist, views fine arts as more than 
                    just colors and lines; they are a profound means of expressing life in all its manifestations. 
                    Born and raised in Sudan, he was inspired by the simplicity and natural beauty of his surroundings, 
                    which deeply shaped his creative vision of the world around him. Muhammad believes that fine arts 
                    are not merely a profession or a hobby but a passion that touches his soul and gives him the 
                    perseverance to move forward despite all challenges. The war that disrupted his life was not an 
                    end but a new beginning that pushed him to explore deeper aspects of himself and his art. His 
                    paintings now embody humanitarian and national issues, carrying messages of hope and peace amidst 
                    pain. His passion for persistence stems from his belief that an artist is a mirror of society and 
                    a storyteller of its struggles. Art, for him, holds the power to create real change. 
                    Muhammad continuously seeks new ways to express himself whether through using recycled materials, 
                    blending painting with photography, or creating works that reflect daily life in Sudan. Muhammad 
                    sees art as an invitation to freedom, a quest for hidden beauty in the simplest things. He believes 
                    it is a universal language that transcends borders and eras, uniting people and inspiring them.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> The painting reflects the lives of millions of children in Sudan, where their 
                    innocence intertwines with the harshness of reality. Despite the simplicity and challenges of 
                    life, the colors radiate hope and express their dreams of a safer and happier future.

                <p><b>Bio:</b> Rabab Chamseddine is a Beirut- and Tyre-based Lebanese photographer and poet whose work 
                    explores the profound and symbiotic connection between people and their land, particularly in the 
                    South of Lebanon. Her lens reveals the pleasures of life in the South and its ongoing land-based 
                    traditional practices as acts of resistance against occupation and colonial threats. Rabab’s photography 
                    has been exhibited at the Beirut Art Center during the event <i dir="rtl" lang="ar">يا رايح عالجنوب </i> 
                    (Ya Rayeh 3al Janoub), and her poetry has appeared in We Call to the Eye & the Night: Love Poems by Writers of Arab Heritage 
                    (Persea Books, 2003). Her practice of photography began in February 2024, a few months after the Aqsa 
                    Flood operation (October 7, 2023). She was driven by an urgent need to document life in her Lebanese 
                    village bordering Palestine during a time of revolution. This journey deepened her connection to the land, 
                    where her Palestinian neighbors' fight for liberation reawakened her senses and perspective. The urban 
                    life, the land and its people, with their zaatar sieves and fishnets, now represent a profound ideal — 
                    what Frantz Fanon describes as 'the most spontaneous and radically revolutionary force'.

                <p><b>Artwork:</b> The photograph represents the South of Lebanon to the artist. The woman on the picture, 
                    Noura, is pounding her zaatar in Sojod. The South has become an ideology, a way of living — one of 
                    actively partaking in the lifecycle of the land, not only by tending to it but also by indulging in 
                    all it has to offer.
