                <p>The artwork features a life-sized, sculpted olive tree crafted from a mix of iron and reclaimed wood, 
                    symbolizing resilience and the rootedness of cultural identity. The tree's branches stretch upwards, 
                    bearing leaves made of broken mirrors that reflect fragments of light, representing hope, resistance, 
                    and the power of collective action.
                    Beneath the tree lies a foundation of soil interspersed with shattered chains, hinting at the 
                    liberation from oppression. Embedded into the soil are items of daily life from diverse cultures—ceramic pots, 
                    embroidered fabrics, and traditional tools—signifying the resilience of ordinary people and the stories tied 
                    to their struggles.
                    Suspended above the tree are doves in flight, made of delicate wire mesh and translucent paper</p>
