                <p><b>Bio:</b> Ali Asfour a Palestinian, Ramallah-based analog film photographer currently in Amman,
                    who skillfully balances exposing the Palestinian existence with preserving the beauty of its
                    roots, culture, and traditions. His work embodies the resilience of a people striving to thrive
                    despite adversity, inviting reflection and action toward justice.
                    Through his art, he revives the silent narratives of Palestinian life, weaving visual stories that
                    evoke both longing and nostalgia. His cinematic imagery and exploration of everyday
                    moments stand as powerful testimonies to the humanity of the Palestinian people, resisting
                    erasure and revealing the complex layers of their experience. Asfour’s photography was
                    recently showcased in a solo exhibition at New York’s Institute of Arab and Islamic Art and
                    has been featured in notable publications, including GQ Middle East, Atmos, and The New
                    Arab, as well as pages such as Waastaa and Nowness Asia. In addition to his work in
                    photography. He is a DJ and music selector with a deep passion for exploring diverse
                    musical landscapes. His sets are inspired by various sounds and scenes, embracing
                    rhythms and influences from different cultures and collectives worldwide. He also hosts a
                    monthly show on Mutant Radio, SADAA: Echoes of the MENA, where he delves into the
                    vibrant musical tapestry of the MENA region, connecting listeners to its rich, ever-evolving
                    sound.

                <p style="text-align: center;"><i>"Roots of Memory"</i></p>
                <p>The image unfolds like a story layered with time. The old man, his
                    kuffiyeh draped with quiet pride. From his eye, the olive tree emerges—a symbol of rooted
                    defiance, its branches stretching toward futures yet untold. Behind him, a group of young
                    women sit, their presence tender yet powerful, like daughters woven into the fabric of the
                    land that he carries with him. This is not an isolated portrait; it is Palestine itself—a
                    convergence of memory and life, of generations bound by the soil, the struggle, and the
                    enduring love for what remains. The land is not just a backdrop but a living thread,
                    connecting the scars of the past to the quiet strength of those who will inherit its story.
